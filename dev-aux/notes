Conventions:
- When a function needs to know the name of a unique row ID in `df`, the argument name is `row_id`.
- When a function needs the user to supply a name for a row ID variable that will be added to `df` by the function, the argument name is `id_name`.
- When a function takes a vector of variables as an argument, the argument name is prefixed with "var_"
